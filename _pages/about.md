<!-- <p> -->

I am an experienced M&A professional that is also passionate about Machine Learning & analytics. I am a big fan of attempts to explain complex concepts through visualization. That's why I like to deploy the final product of my projects in a web application that is hosted on Shiny Server. I am also very comfortable dealing with complex datasets.

This website is currently in development; I still have a couple of blogs to write about on the independent projects that I worked on listed on my Github. Please access my Github if you are interested in reading about other projects that I did. 

Hope, you find the blogs interesting. Thank you for taking the time to read them.
